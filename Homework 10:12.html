    <ol>
        <li style="color:#33CC33"> About Me-Passion and Positivity</li>
        <p>Positivity and passion are major components in my personality. Thanks to my parents who have an open and encouraging attitude toward our education. During my school life, I not only joined basketball, football team and all kinds of school association but also social issue and backpacking. Such enthusiasm makes me persistent in whatever I do, social enterprise and rural community work, for instance.</p>
        <li style="color:#33CC33">Cross-Border Thinking- T-Shaped People and Learning By Doing</li>
        <p>As a MBA graduate, I look forward to become T-shaped people. I keep the habit of reading extensively; learning from internship and running different projects. Through learning by doing, I gain a better understanding of industry. Last year I stepped into ecological agriculture the area which is completely new to me. From zero to one, I realized the importance of cross-border, that is, perceptive thinking in this changing world. It helps me solve more systematic problems.</p>
        <li style="color:#33CC33">Innovation-Entrepreneurship - Take the Risk</li>
        <p>"Making the world and society" into a better level has been a motto that drives in my blood. I see myself as an individual with this passion of looking into a core problem to provide great ideas or solutions -"innovative entrepreneurship." Me and my partners instead of visiting minor community, we solved the systematic problem by sixth industrialization(六級產業化). Although we failed, I take it as a great learning experience. I'm not afraid of old thinking and distrust of the locals. Challenges and risks are precious to me. I believe I can create higher value for company in the near future.</p>
        <li style="color:#33CC33">Goal Orientation- Strategy and Plan</li>
        <p>I'm a goal-oriented person in life, work and study. Everything starts from framing a clear goal; researching useful data and planning practical steps efficiently. Before heading to Thailand for internship I've taken the initiative to discuss my work with the company manger via e-mail. With clear plan and full background research, I have actually achieved my goal in two months.</p>
        <li style="color:#33CC33">Global View-Embrace the World</li>
        <p>From backpacking, oversea internship(China, Thailand) and international social enterprise research(UK, Germany, Singapore), I know I'm able to fit in everywhere in the world and learn how to embrace different cultures. I'm equipped myself with independent thinking and efficient learning skills. Meanwhile, I pay attention to international news and observe regional differences; with such global information I can contribute to the business strategy of company.</p>
        <li style="color:#33CC33">Leadership and Teamwork</li>
        <p>Professor Manfred Kets de Vries from INSTEAD stated, "leadership is a process of teamwork." I strongly agree with this saying which i've experienced from my business startup, even in my school sport team. To further illustrate this concept, open communication is the key to a good teamwork, also the cooperation between team and team. I have applied for subsidy projects and ran various projects many times before, my master school course focus on English presentation. Therefore, I'm confident in presenting myself, making proposals and projects. In the future, I will definitely apply this ability in relevant area.</p>
        <li style="color:#33CC33">Social Empathy-Spirit Of Social Enterprise</li>
        <p>The responsibility of social enterprise should not only lie on NPO but also on every company, meaning that every business is social enterprise. Realizing that companies nowadays are actually surrounded by severer challenges of economy, society and environment, my ultimate goal is helping organizations with my years of passion for social enterprise to achieve the concept. To sum up, I want to make the world better with company.kk</p>
